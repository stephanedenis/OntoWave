# Issue: Progressive examples validation needed

## Description
The progressive examples (01-minimal.html, 02-basic-config.html, etc.) need to be validated to ensure they work as advertised.

## Examples to check
- [x] 01-minimal.html - Basic setup (8 lines of HTML)
- [ ] 02-basic-config.html - With custom options
- [ ] 03-dark-theme.html - Custom styles and colors  
- [ ] 04-advanced-config.html - Advanced features
- [ ] 05-mkdocs-style.html - Complete MkDocs-like interface
- [ ] gallery.html - Overview of all demos

## Validation criteria
- Files exist and load properly
- Functionality matches description
- OntoWave loads and works correctly
- No console errors
- Visual appearance matches expectations

## Action needed
- Test each example file
- Fix non-working examples or remove broken links
- Update descriptions to match actual functionality

## Priority
Medium - affects user experience and documentation accuracy
